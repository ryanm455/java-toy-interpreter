# Java Interpreter

This is a simple interpreter written in Java.
Just a proof of concept, you probably shouldn't use it for real.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This interpreter uses no external libraries, only the Java JDK is required.

## Usage

1. Write your code to a text file.

   ```txt
   print "Hello, World!";
   x = 5;
   y = 10;
   print x + y;
   ```

2. Compile and run the interpreter from your IDE or using the command line and add the file as an argument. This will execute your code and display the output in the console.

You can also run the interpreter without any arguments to open a basic REPL.

## Features

- Basic support for variable assignment and expression evaluation.
- Output to the console using the `print` statement.
- While loop, if-else, and functions.
